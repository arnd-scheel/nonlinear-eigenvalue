# nonlinear-eigenvalue

Code for computing singularities of the pointwise resolvent for linear operators on the real line
Equations are given in the forma u_x=A(x;lambda)u, with A(x;lambda) to A_\pm(x;lambda)
Code findst closest singularity to a reference starting point

Subdirectory constant_coefficient treats problems where A(x;lambda)=A(lambda), polynomial in lambda
Subdirectory variable_coefficient allows for x-dependence
